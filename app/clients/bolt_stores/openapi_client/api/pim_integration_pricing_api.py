        """Import selling prices

        Updates base (i.e., not discounted) selling prices for SKUs.   This is a **synchronous operation**. After its successful completion, the new price list will be created and applied during the next menu publishing.  If the `provider_ids` parameter is set, the prices will be applied to specific stores only. For all other stores, existing prices will retain their values.  If the `provider_ids` parameter is not set, the prices will be overwritten for every store in the region.  **IMPORTANT**: All prices are now listed as **net of bottle deposits and other applicable fees**.  This means that additional fees such as bottle deposits are not included in the listed price.  Fees are specified separately under the fees attribute in the product details.  Each fee in the array includes an `sku` indicating the type of fee (e.g., `bottle_deposit`, `sup_container`, `sup_cup`) and may include a `multiplier` to apply the fee to multiple items in a pack.  For example, a 6-pack of Coca-Cola would have a `fees` entry like this: `fees: [{sku: \"bottle_deposit\", multiplier: 6}]`, where the `bottle_deposit` fee is applied six times, once for each bottle in the pack.  The price of each fee type is defined by its own unique SKU and is added to the product price accordingly.  Fees are added as options to the item and are visible to the user, ensuring transparency in pricing.  Deprecation Notice: The previous method of applying the `bottle_deposit` tag directly to products is deprecated but will continue to be supported for a transitional period.  Adopt the new `fees` system for greater flexibility and clarity in fee management.  **IMPORTANT**: The total count of imported prices should not exceed 20 000, otherwise a `400 Bad Request` error will be returned.   **IMPORTANT**: If you wish to upload the price not for an increment (the pack that's sold) but per specific unit (kg or liter), you can use the field `price_measure_unit`. When the price for a specific SKU is uploaded not per piece but per unit, the final price for the increment (pack) will be calculated and assigned to the item during the menu publishing process. If left empty, this field will be interpreted as 'piece,' which means the uploaded price will be treated as the regular increment (pack) price.  **NB**. Importing base prices does not automatically update  the menu in the Bolt Food app. To do so, the menu publishing flow needs to be invoked.

        """Import discount selling price list

        Updates or adds discount selling prices for SKUs. This is a **synchronous operation**. The discounted prices are applied **immediately**, no menu  publishing is needed.  If the `provider_ids` parameter is set, the discount prices will be created for specific stores only. For all other stores, no changes will be made. On the other hand, if the `provider_ids` parameter is not set, the new discount prices will be created for every store in the region.  Note that each discount price will only become active after the corresponding `active_from` timestamp has passed.  On activation of newly imported discount prices, pre-existing discount prices will be retained if there is no new entry for a `sku` + `price_type` pair, otherwise, values are overridden.  **IMPORTANT**: If you wish to upload the discounted price not for an increment (the pack that's sold) but per specific unit (kg or liter), you can use the field `price_measure_unit`. When the price for a specific SKU is uploaded not per piece but per unit, the final price for the increment (pack) will be calculated and assigned to the item during the menu publishing process. If left empty, this field will be interpreted as 'piece,' which means the uploaded price will be treated as the regular increment (pack) price.  **IMPORTANT**: All prices are now listed as **net of bottle deposits and other applicable fees**.  This means that additional fees such as bottle deposits are not included in the listed price.  Fees are specified separately under the fees attribute in the product details.  Each fee in the array includes an `sku` indicating the type of fee (e.g., `bottle_deposit`, `sup_container`, `sup_cup`) and may include a `multiplier` to apply the fee to multiple items in a pack.  For example, a 6-pack of Coca-Cola would have a `fees` entry like this: `fees: [{sku: \"bottle_deposit\", multiplier: 6}]`, where the `bottle_deposit` fee is applied six times, once for each bottle in the pack.  The price of each fee type is defined by its own unique SKU and is added to the product price accordingly.  Fees are added as options to the item and are visible to the user, ensuring transparency in pricing.  Deprecation Notice: The previous method of applying the `bottle_deposit` tag directly to products is deprecated but will continue to be supported for a transitional period.  Adopt the new `fees` system for greater flexibility and clarity in fee management.  **IMPORTANT**: The total count of imported prices (the sum of lengths of all `skus` arrays) should not exceed 20 000, otherwise a `400 Bad Request` error will be returned.
